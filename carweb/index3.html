    <h1> Ford Mustang Mach-E</h1>
    <p>The 2022 Ford Mustang Mach-E blends popular elements <br>
        of the
past and present in a highly desirable package <br>that bodes
well for the future of electric vehicles, which<br> is why we
gave it an Editors' Choice award. While it seems<br> sacrilegious
that Ford would call a crossover EV a Mustang,<br> pairing the iconic 
nameplate with an in-demand body style<br> is smart marketing. Along 
with its attention-getting appearance,<br> the Mach-E has a handsomely
appointed interior that's brimming <br>with the latest tech.Get behind the wheel and the electrified<br> Mustang feels agile
 and quick. The sportiest version hits 60 <br>mph in 3.7 seconds and the
 rangiest versions are estimated to<br> travel more than 300 miles per
charge. All that and more makes<br> the 2022 Mustang Mach-E a transcendent EV.
